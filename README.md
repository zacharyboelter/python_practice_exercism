# Python Concepts Exploration

This short exploration covers fundamentals of generators, lambda functions, and higher-order functions like `map()` and `filter()`. These concepts enhance efficiency and code expressiveness in Python.

## Generators

* **What are they?** Special functions that produce a sequence of values on demand, not all at once. They employ the `yield` keyword.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Memory efficiency:** Ideal for large datasets by avoiding pre-calculating an entire list.
    * **Lazy evaluation:** Values are computed only when needed.

* **Example:**

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

for num in countdown(5):
    print(num)  # Output: 5 4 3 2 1
